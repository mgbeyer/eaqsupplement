This project contains supplementary material which is meant to support the evaluation chapter of our thesis paper. 

The evaluation target scenario is based on a case study by The OpenGroup (see below) about a fictitious manufacturer named ArchiMetal, a mid-sized company that produces steel products used in building construction and other industries. 
Specific analyses typically yield large datasets whose size would go far beyond the scope of the appendix section of our thesis. Therefore we opted to bundle them using a freely accessible RWTH GitLab space. Here you will find complete datasets which provide evidence and support the evaluation of our metric suite, along with the XQuery code that produced them.

### Context of Supplementary Queries and Datasets

The metric suite presented in our thesis paper and embedded in the accompanying software (EAQTool), as well as all queries presented here were run against the ArchiMetal model version Y164 (see below).

All queries used to produce the datasets presented here are strictly derived from the metric suite as presented in our thesis and used in the software tool (cf. the "metrics.json" definition file in the "metrics" package of the EAQTool source code). They have been adapted to represent the respective metric in a different context, mostly to show a non-aggregated and more specific result, e.g. per view and not overall. Their basic metric computation is exactly the same, they will produce the same aggregated results as presented in the evaluation chapter of our thesis.
